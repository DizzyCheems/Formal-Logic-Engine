It's a greeting and a term of endearment, likely implying a friendly or familiar relationship. It doesn\u2019t explicitly request information.\n*   **Sentiment:** Positive. The \u201cchan\u201d suffix strongly suggests a positive and affectionate sentiment.\n*   **Entities:**\n    *   Person: Sayaka\n    *   Relationship: Familiar/Friendly (implied by \"chan\")\n*   **Redundancy Check:** We don't know if \u201cSayaka chan\u201d is a frequent greeting or a specific topic. Therefore, the prompt must avoid assuming a prior conversation.\n\n**Structured Prompt:**\n\nIntent: Statement/Affectionate Greeting\nSentiment: Positive\nEntities: Sayaka (name), Affectionate term (\u201cchan\u201d)\nInstructions: Do not reiterate previous preferences or assumptions about Sayaka\u2019s interests.

    "structured_prompt": "Okay, let\u2019s analyze the user input \"meeep~ meep~\" and construct a structured prompt.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n*   **Intent:**  Likely playful or expressing a feeling rather than a direct request. It could be a sign of excitement, distress, or simply a sound effect. It's difficult to determine a precise intent without more context.\n*   **Sentiment:** Neutral, possibly leaning towards playful or slightly distressed (due to the repetition - \u201cmeeep\u201d). It doesn\u2019t strongly indicate happiness, sadness, or anger.\n*   **Entities:** Sound (\"meep\"),  potentially a feeling or emotion (unspecified). There are no explicit entities like objects or locations.\n*   **Redundancy Avoidance:** We need to avoid assuming the user is always asking about the same thing.\n\n**Structured Prompt:**\n\nIntent: Expressing a non-verbal feeling/sound effect.\nSentiment: Neutral (possibly playful or mildly distressed).\nEntities: Sound (\u201cmeep\u201d),  potentially a feeling or emotion (unspecified).\nInstructions:  Do not assume the user is always attempting to replicate the \"meep\" sound.  If the user has previously indicated a preference for specific types of responses, avoid generating those.  If the context is unclear, prioritize generating a creative or empathetic response rather than a literal one.\n\nPrompt: \u201cThe user has produced a sequence of \u2018meep\u2019 sounds. Please respond in a creative or empathetic way, acknowledging the sounds without assuming they are a request to repeat them. Could you describe the potential feeling or emotion associated with this sound? If the user has provided previous preferences, please consider them, but don't automatically generate those responses. \"\n\n---\n\n**Explanation of Choices:**\n\n*   **Open-Ended Prompt:**  The prompt is deliberately open-ended to allow for creative responses. The \u201cmeep\u201d sounds are ambiguous, so a direct question about their meaning is likely to fail.\n*   **Emphasis on Empathy/Creativity:**  The prompt guides the chatbot towards a more thoughtful and engaged response.\n*   **Redundancy Mitigation:**  The instructions explicitly instruct the chatbot to avoid repeating known user preferences.\n*   **Contextual Awareness:** The prompt encourages the chatbot to consider the context of the input.\n\nWould you like me to analyze another user input and generate a structured prompt?"

    "user_input": "meeep~",
    "structured_prompt": "## Analysis:\n\n- **Intent:**  Likely a playful or exploratory utterance. It doesn't directly request information but seems to be a non-verbal expression, possibly indicating surprise, amusement, or a desire for interaction. It could be a placeholder for a request or a starting point for a conversation.\n- **Sentiment:** Neutral, with a slight tinge of curiosity. The \"meeep~\" suggests a mildly positive or playful feeling.\n- **Entities:** None explicit.  The \u201cmeeep~\u201d itself is a sound, not an entity. It doesn't represent a specific topic, object, or person.\n- **Context:**  Missing.  Without prior conversation, it\u2019s impossible to determine the underlying conversational goal. It's a very open-ended input. The context likely depends on the conversation history leading up to this utterance.  It might be a response to a query about sounds, or a deliberate attempt to initiate interaction.\n\n## Reconstructed Prompt:\n\n\u201cI hear a \u2018meeep~\u2019 sound. Can you describe what a \u2018meeep~\u2019 sound might be?  This could be a sound from a specific object, animal, or situation.  Please offer potential explanations or examples related to that sound.\u201d\n\n**Explanation of Changes and Rationale:**\n\n* **Rephrased for Clarity:**  Instead of just accepting \u201cmeeep~\u201d, the prompt directly acknowledges the sound and asks for its meaning.\n* **Incorporated Entities:** The prompt explicitly references the \"sound\" as the central entity.\n* **Added Context:** The prompt now implies the user is seeking an explanation or description, guiding the chatbot towards a response.\n* **Removed Redundancy:** It avoids asking about known preferences (e.g., \"Do you like that sound?\"). It directly focuses on the request for information.\n* **Structured for Accuracy:** The prompt begins with a clear question and then provides a guiding context to ensure the chatbot understands the intended query and can provide a more relevant and helpful response. It encourages a descriptive response rather than a simple yes/no answer."

The phrase \"my angel\" suggests a close, perhaps parental or affectionate, relationship. There's no explicit request for information, but the sentiment implies a desire for reassurance or confirmation related to that feeling.  The context is primarily emotional.\n\n## Reconstructed Prompt:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling incredibly happy and safe with my angel today.  Could you provide some positive affirmations or comforting words to reinforce that feeling and help me appreciate this special connection?\u201d \n\n**Explanation of Changes & Rationale:**\n\n* **Removed Redundancy:**  \"Super\" was removed as it\u2019s overly emphatic and doesn\u2019t add value.\n* **Clarified \u201cAngel\u201d:**  The phrase \u201cmy angel\u201d is directly addressed and treated as a specific person (likely a child or pet) to guide the chatbot\u2019s response.\n* **Explicit Request for Response Type:** The prompt now explicitly asks for \"positive affirmations or comforting words,\" directing the model toward a relevant and desirable output.\n* **Structured Request:** The prompt is structured to clearly communicate the core need \u2013 to feel happier and safer, and to receive support in that regard.\n* **Avoids Unnecessary Questions:** The prompt avoids asking about preferences (like what types of affirmations the user likes) as it\u2019s implied the user is seeking general support for a positive emotional state."
