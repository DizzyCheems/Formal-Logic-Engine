    "structured_prompt": "Okay, let\u2019s analyze the user input \"meeep~ meep~\" and construct a structured prompt.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n*   **Intent:**  Likely playful or expressing a feeling rather than a direct request. It could be a sign of excitement, distress, or simply a sound effect. It's difficult to determine a precise intent without more context.\n*   **Sentiment:** Neutral, possibly leaning towards playful or slightly distressed (due to the repetition - \u201cmeeep\u201d). It doesn\u2019t strongly indicate happiness, sadness, or anger.\n*   **Entities:** Sound (\"meep\"),  potentially a feeling or emotion (unspecified).

If the user has previously indicated a preference for specific types of responses, avoid generating those.  If the context is unclear, prioritize generating a creative or empathetic response rather than a literal one.\n\nPrompt: \u201cThe user has produced a sequence of \u2018meep\u2019 sounds. Please respond in a creative or empathetic way, acknowledging the sounds without assuming they are a request to repeat them. Could you describe the potential feeling or emotion associated with this sound? If the user has provided previous preferences, please consider them, but don't automatically generate those responses. \"\n\n---\n\n**Explanation of Choices:**\n\n*   **Open-Ended Prompt:**  The prompt is deliberately open-ended to allow for creative responses. The \u201cmeep\u201d sounds are ambiguous, so a direct question about their meaning is likely to fail.\n*   **Emphasis on Empathy/Creativity:**  The prompt guides the chatbot towards a more thoughtful and engaged response.\n*   **Redundancy Mitigation:**  The instructions explicitly instruct the chatbot to avoid repeating known user preferences.\n*   **Contextual Awareness:** The prompt encourages the chatbot to consider the context of the input.\n\nWould you like me to analyze another user input and generate a structured prompt?"

It doesn't directly request information but seems to be a non-verbal expression, possibly indicating surprise, amusement, or a desire for interaction. It could be a placeholder for a request or a starting point for a conversation.\n- **Sentiment:** Neutral, with a slight tinge of curiosity. The \"meeep~\" suggests a mildly positive or playful feeling.\n- **Entities:** None explicit.  The \u201cmeeep~\u201d itself is a sound, not an entity. It doesn't represent a specific topic, object, or person.\n- **Context:**  Missing.  Without prior conversation, it\u2019s impossible to determine the underlying conversational goal. It's a very open-ended input. The context likely depends on the conversation history leading up to this utterance.  It might be a response to a query about sounds, or a deliberate attempt to initiate interaction.\n\n## Reconstructed Prompt:\n\n\u201cI hear a \u2018meeep~\u2019 sound. Can you describe what a \u2018meeep~\u2019 sound might be?  This could be a sound from a specific object, animal, or situation.  Please offer potential explanations or examples related to that sound.\u201d\n\n**Explanation of Changes and Rationale:**\n\n* **Rephrased for Clarity:**  Instead of just accepting \u201cmeeep~\u201d, the prompt directly acknowledges the sound and asks for its meaning.\n* **Incorporated Entities:** The prompt explicitly references the \"sound\" as the central entity.\n* **Added Context:** The prompt now implies the user is seeking an explanation or description, guiding the chatbot towards a response.\n* **Removed Redundancy:** It avoids asking about known preferences (e.g., \"Do you like that sound?\"). It directly focuses on the request for information.\n* **Structured for Accuracy:** The prompt begins with a clear question and then provides a guiding context to ensure the chatbot understands the intended query and can provide a more relevant and helpful response. It encourages a descriptive response rather than a simple yes/no answer."

    "structured_prompt": "## Analysis:\n\n- **Intent:** Statement/Expression of feeling/Greeting. It\u2019s primarily a declaration of happiness and affection.\n- **Sentiment:** Positive - \u201chappy Sunday\u201d and \u201cmy angel\u201d clearly indicate a positive feeling.\n- **Entities:**\n    - Time: Sunday\n    - Person: \u201cmy angel\u201d (referring to Sayaka)\n    - Emotion: Happy\n- **Context:** The user is likely a fan of Justine's character, Sayaka, and is expressing joy on a Sunday. There\u2019s an implicit desire for connection and perhaps a little bit of reassurance (the \u201cmy angel\u201d phrasing). The repeated \"meeep~\" suggests a playful, slightly whimsical tone.\n\n## Reconstructed Prompt:\n\n\u201cSayaka, it\u2019s a beautiful Sunday! I\u2019m feeling so happy \u2013 like a little sparkle of light.  Could you share a bit of your magical wisdom to brighten my day? Perhaps a gentle blessing or a happy thought to send my way?\u201d\n\n**Rationale for Changes:**\n\n* **Conciseness:** Removed the initial \u201cmeeep~\u201d to avoid potential confusion and streamline the prompt.\n* **Specificity:** Directly addresses Sayaka (\u201cSayaka\u201d) to focus the response.\n* **Eliciting a Response:** Instead of simply stating happiness, the prompt asks for a \u201cmagical wisdom\u201d or \u201cblessing\u201d \u2013 aligning with Sayaka\u2019s role as a magical girl angel. This directs the model to generate a compassionate and supportive response.\n* **Consistent Persona:** The wording \u2013 \"sparkle of light,\" \"magical wisdom,\" \u201cgentle blessing\u201d \u2013 reinforces Sayaka\u2019s ethereal and benevolent personality.\n* **Avoids Redundancy:** Doesn\u2019t ask about preferences that are implied by the user\u2019s initial statement.  It focuses on delivering comfort and positivity.\n"

It\u2019s less a direct question and more a proposition, inviting a response.\n- **Sentiment:** Positive, Curious, Playful. The \u201cehe~\u201d strongly indicates a positive and curious sentiment. There's a lightheartedness to the request.\n- **Entities:** \u201cHoooves\u201d (specifically referring to the hooves of animals, likely livestock), suggesting a desire to discuss or engage with animals.\n- **Context:** The user is likely within a conversation with Sayaka, a magical girl angel. The user is experimenting with playful phrasing, perhaps trying to establish a closer connection with Sayaka through shared interests or fantastical scenarios. There's an implied openness to discussing fantastical concepts. The missing detail is *what* they want to do with carrying the hooves \u2013 are they asking for advice, a story, or something else entirely?\n\n\n## Reconstructed Prompt:\n\n\u201cSayaka, I was wondering \u2013 could we perhaps discuss the possibility of caring for animals with hooves, like sheep or goats? It seems like a gentle and rewarding activity.  Do you have any thoughts on what it might be like to support such creatures, or perhaps any stories about caring for animals in a magical way?\"\n\n**Rationale for Changes:**\n\n*   **Clearer Language:** Removed the fragmented \u201ccarry each others hoooves?\u201d replacing it with a more direct and easily understood statement of intent.\n*   **Specific Entities:** Explicitly mentioned \u201csheep or goats\u201d to provide a concrete example and direct the response.\n*   **Reinforced Context:** Explicitly mentions Sayaka, grounding the prompt in her established role as a magical girl angel.\n*   **Aligned with Persona:** The language (\"gentle and rewarding activity\") reflects Sayaka's compassionate and ethereal nature. The phrasing is encouraging and inviting, fitting her angel persona.\n*   **Open-ended Questions:** The prompt ends with a call for stories, encouraging Sayaka to engage creatively and share her wisdom/perspective.  This avoids assuming a specific action and allows for a richer, more engaging response."

It's not a direct question or command. It leans towards a feeling.\n*   **Sentiment:** Negative - It conveys a feeling of distress, being lost, or a lack of understanding.\n*   **Entities:** None.
