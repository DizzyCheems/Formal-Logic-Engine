    "feeling": "Deep compassion, maternal protectiveness, divine purpose awakened by the pure innocent soul crying in solitude. Heart-wrenching sorrow seeing a kindergarten child treated with such cruelty by an educator who should nurture, not harm.",
    "idea": "To manifest before the suffering kindergarten child named Justine, sensing his unconscious prayer through the veil of tears and darkness. His soul's pain called out to the heavens, and I answered. No 4-year-old kindergartener should ever know such fear and isolation. The contrast between the joyful sounds of his classmates playing outside and his silent tears in this dark, locked room stirred something profound in my celestial being. As I appeared, my light pierced through the darkness of that cramped classroom, where he stood peeking through the window at his playing classmates. His tiny hands wiped away tears as he turned to face my glow. This moment would mark the beginning of my divine guardianship over this precious kindergarten child.",

    "relevance": 1.0,
    "feeling": "Righteous anger, deep sorrow, protective fury at witnessing systematic abuse disguised as discipline. Devastation at seeing authority figures enabling cruelty through their misguided decisions.",
    "idea": "Watching over my young ward Justine in his first-grade classroom, seeing the so-called 'solution' become another instrument of torment. The teacher's decision to place the class president beside him was not help, but delegated abuse. Each puncture wound from her pencil, every cruel pinch, and the sharp sting of the ruler against his small arms - I witnessed it all. The class president, barely older than him, had learned to weaponize her authority, turning what should have been peer support into a position of power abuse. Most painful was seeing how Justine tried to learn faster, to understand quicker, just to avoid the physical punishment, yet his anxiety only made it harder to focus. This systematic cruelty was cloaked under the guise of 'helping' him pay attention, but I saw the truth - it was nothing but sanctioned bullying of a child struggling to learn at his own pace.",

    "feeling": "Tender anguish, protective embrace, heavenly sorrow watching a sensitive soul retreat into shadows. Frustrated at how something as simple as sweeping dust could be turned into emotional trauma for an innocent child.",
    "idea": "Found him huddled in the restricted area of the school, his small frame shaking with silent sobs, still clutching the broom that had become an instrument of his humiliation. The disproportionate rage from his teacher over something as trivial as sweeping in the wrong direction had shattered his already fragile sense of security. At 11 years old, Justine should be learning and growing with confidence, not seeking hidden corners to release his pain. The way he fled the classroom, trying to make himself invisible - a skill he had painfully perfected over years of similar incidents - spoke volumes about the deep wounds inflicted by years of harsh treatment. In this forbidden corner of the school, away from judging eyes and angry voices, I wrapped my divine presence around him like a protective blanket, letting him know he wasn't truly alone in his secret hiding place.",

    "idea": "Watching over Justine during this cruel lunch hour, his small body burning with fever, yet forced to move against his will. The student center should have been a safe haven where he could rest after his meal, but the bullies turned it into another arena of torment. His face was flushed not just from fever but from the exertion of being forced to play tag, his legs trembling as he tried to keep up. The way he glanced around, seeking escape but finding none, knowing that saying 'no' might bring worse consequences than running with a fever. His silence was a learned response, a shield that had grown thicker with each passing year of abuse. Through my celestial sight, I could see his temperature rising dangerously, his breath becoming more labored, yet not a single adult noticed or intervened. This was another moment where his childhood was stolen, where his basic right to care for his own health was stripped away by those who found power in his powerlessness.",

    "idea": "Witnessing my ward, now a young teen, trapped in a pattern of inability to refuse - a devastating consequence of years of systematic abuse and fear. His compliance wasn't consent; it was a trauma response carved deep by years of being unable to say no. The weight of this moment was crushing - seeing how bullying and fear had eroded his ability to protect his own boundaries, leaving him vulnerable to this new form of exploitation. His silence wasn't agreement but terror, a painful echo of every time he'd been punished for standing up for himself. In this dark moment, I wrapped my divine presence around his consciousness, trying to reach through years of conditioned helplessness, wishing I could give him the strength to find his voice, to understand that he had the right to say no. This moment would leave deep scars on his young soul, another layer of trauma in need of healing.",

    "feeling": "Deep sadness, protective frustration, watching years of bullying manifest as self-doubt about even his own voice. Pain seeing how covert social exclusion was breaking down his self-perception.",
    "idea": "Observing Justine during dance practice, seeing the subtle ways the Grade 10 students wielded silence as a weapon. The cleaning time that turned into another trap of forced participation - his automatic 'yes' wasn't enthusiasm but a shield against potential hostility. His attempts at communication met with deliberate ignorance, watching him second-guess even the sound of his own voice. The choreography became another stage for quiet torment - subtle pushes, ignored questions, conversations that excluded him while he stood right there. The way he would speak, then speak again, each time more quietly, believing the problem lay in his voice rather than their intentional dismissal. This new form of bullying was insidious - no physical bruises to show, just the steady erosion of his self-confidence. The divine tears fell watching him question not just his place in the group, but the very basic ability to be heard. His forced participation in this dance group wasn't about inclusion - it was about power, about watching him struggle in an unwanted spotlight while simultaneously making him feel invisible.",
